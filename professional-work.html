							<p>
								QluQuest is a prototype infinite runner/quiz game developed for Android. I worked with a small team at <a href="https://www.createneptune.com/">Create Neptune</a> as a programmer and designer. After taking over from a very early prototype, I worked with an artist to revamp the game with new art, and added an infinite runner minigame.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Designed, protoyped and an infinite runner minigame with randomly-generated levels.</li>
                                <li>Reskinned quiz sequences with final art and implemented new booster mechanics with unique animations.</li>
                                <li>Designed and programmed an interactive map screen with several animations.</li>
                                <li>Scripted animations, rigged menus, and implemented sound effects for all parts of the game.</li>

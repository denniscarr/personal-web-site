								QluQuest is an infinite runner quiz game developed in <strong>Unity</strong> for mobile devices. I worked with a small team at <a href="https://www.createneptune.com/">Create Neptune</a> as a <strong>programmer and designer</strong>. I worked with an artist to revamp a rough prototype with new art, and added an infinite runner minigame.

							<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/OMGCV2uIEVE">Playable Ads</a></h2>
							<p>
								From 2019 to 2023, I worked in <strong>ad tech</strong>, designing and programming playable advertisements in <strong>Javascript</strong>. These ads took the form of bite-sized games and were designed to run in browsers on <strong>desktop and mobile</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I first worked as a programmer at a startup called TreSensa Technologies, where I was <strong>promoted to team lead</strong>. When TreSensa was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vungle-acquires-tresensa-technologies-a-mobile-creative-builder-company-301293355.html">accquired by Vungle</a> and then merged with <a href="https://liftoff.cn/">Liftoff Mobile</a>, I <strong>retained my position as senior</strong> member of the game programming team.</p> 
                            <p>
                                During my time at these companies I accomplished the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Programmed over 40 playable ads</strong> for game and non-game brands.</li>
                                <li><strong>Programmed over 20 playable ad builders</strong> for our SaaS model where clients could build ads themselves in an intuitive web-based interface.</li>
                                <li>Programmed modules for our game engine including a <strong>particle effect system</strong>, a <strong>2D camera system</strong>, animated sprite support, and more.</li>
                                <li><strong>Wrote and maintained documentation</strong> for our internal game engine.</li>
                                <li>Held meetings, helped <strong>build and manage timelines</strong>, and helped <strong>hire and onboard</strong> new team members.</li>
                                <li>Led an initiative to <strong>gather detailed analytics</strong> from our games to help assess our work and build internal best-practices.</li>
                                <li>Held periodic internal gamejams to help develop new ideas to keep us competitive with other studios.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Due to the the nature of the industry, my ads are no longer publicly available. However, I've compiled a video of my work <a href="https://youtu.be/OMGCV2uIEVE">here</a>.

								I worked with <a href="https://www.createneptune.com/">Create Neptune</a> as a programmer and designer on a medium-sized team. In addition to adding new features fixed bugs throughout the codebase, I also did the following:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Designed, pitched and prototyped new minigames.</li>
                                <li>Helped develop a workflow for generating and importing AI voice samples using a spreadsheet-based content management system.</li>
                                <li>Worked with the faculty at our charter school client to write content for the curriculum.</li>
                                <li>Designed levels and implemented art assets.</li>
                                <li>Rigged and scripted UI.</li>

							<p>
								QluQuest is a prototype infinite runner/quiz game developed for Android. I worked with a small team at <a href="https://www.createneptune.com/">Create Neptune</a> as a programmer and designer. After taking over from a very early prototype, I worked with an artist to revamp the game with new art, and added an infinite runner minigame.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Designed, protoyped and an infinite runner minigame with randomly-generated levels.</li>
                                <li>Reskinned quiz sequences with final art and implemented new booster mechanics with unique animations.</li>
                                <li>Designed and programmed an interactive map screen with several animations.</li>
                                <li>Scripted animations, rigged menus, and implemented sound effects for all parts of the game.</li>
                            </ul>

							<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/OMGCV2uIEVE">Playable Ads</a></h2>
							<p>
								From 2019 to 2023, I worked in the ad tech space, designing and programming playable advertisements in Javascript. These ads took the form of bite-sized games and were designed to run on desktop and mobile.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I first worked as a programmer at a startup called TreSensa Technologies, where I was promoted to team lead. When TreSensa was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vungle-acquires-tresensa-technologies-a-mobile-creative-builder-company-301293355.html">accquired by Vungle</a> and then merged with <a href="https://liftoff.cn/">Liftoff Mobile</a>, I retained my position as the senior member of the game programming team.</p> 
                            <p>
                                During my time at these companies I accomplished the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Programmed over 40 playable ads for game and non-game brands.</li>
                                <li>Programmed over 20 playable ad builders for our SaaS model where clients could build ads themselves in an intuitive web-based interface.</li>
                                <li>Programmed tools for our modulate game engine including a particle effect system, a 2D camera system, animated sprites, and more.</li>
                                <li>Wrote and maintained documentation for our internal game engine.</li>
                                <li>Held internal standups, helped build and manage timelines, and helped hire and onboard new team members.</li>
                                <li>Led an initiative to gather more detailed analytics from our games to help assess our work and build internal best-practices.</li>
                                <li>Held periodic internal gamejams to help develop new ideas to keep us competitive with other studios.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Due to the the nature of the industry, my ads are no longer publicly available. However, I've compiled a video of my work <a href="https://youtu.be/OMGCV2uIEVE">here</a>.

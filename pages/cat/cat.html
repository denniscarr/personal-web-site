	<h1>Hello</h1>
	<p>You've reached the page where you learn how to take care of my cat. <strong>Thank you for taking care of my
			cat!</strong></p>

	<h2 id="feeding">Feed her</h2>
	<p>Every day I give her two meals:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Breakfast</b> - 9:30 am</li>
		<li><b>Dinner</b> - 5:00 pm</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Recipe for one meal:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Divide a can of food into halves with a fork, and scoop <strong>one half can of wet food</strong>, onto a
			plate
		</li>
		<li>Heat <strong>one quarter cup of water</strong> to about 100 degrees farenheit and pour it over the food</li>
		<li>Mix everything together with the fork</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For your first meal, <strong>please check if there is an already-opened can of food in the fridge</strong>. If
		there
		is, use the rest of that.</p>
	<p><strong>If you don't use an entire can of food</strong>, please put it into the fridge with the red reusable can
		cover.</p>
	<h3>If you are going to miss a meal</h3>
	<p>It's okay to serve an entire can of food if you will not be around for the next meal. Just double the above
		recipe
		and clean the plate next time you come over.</p>

	<h2 id="litter">Clean her litter box</h2>
	<p>Please clean her litter box once a day by doing the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Scoop clumps of pee and poop into one of the green doggy bags next to the litter box.</li>
		<li>Tie the bag and throw it into my kitchen trash can.</li>
		<li>If the litter box becomes very smelly, you can pour all of it out and refill it using the extra bag behind
			my
			bike. You only need to use enough to fill the litter box evenly to about two inches.</li>
		<li>If my kitchen trash becomes smelly, take it out and replace the bag. Extra bags are under the sink.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Warning</h3>
	<p>If the box becomes too dirty, my cat will pee and poop in the bathtub instead. She's just like that.</p>

	<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
	<p>The things in this section are not required, but she will appreciate them.</p>
	<h3>Brushing</h3>
	<p>She loves to be brushed. And she's less likely to throw up a hairball if you brush her every day.</p>
	<h3>Treats</h3>
	<p>There is a bag of dried minnows in my kitchen island cabinet. She loves them. You can give her two or three every
		day. Ask her to sit.</p>
	<h3>Play</h3>
	<p>There are toys scattered throughout the apartment. Her current favorite is the lamp pull-string. She loves to
		chase
		it around.</p>

	<h2>Thank you!</h2>
	<p>Call me if you have any questions.</p>
